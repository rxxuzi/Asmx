!asmx
# This YAML file configures the build process for an assembly and C project.
# Make sure to start the file with !asmx to ensure it is correctly recognized by the build tool.

# Project name: Specifies the name of the executable file to be generated.
# For example, specifying 'app' results in 'app.exe'.
project : app

# Source code files or directories:
# List all directories or specific files that should be included in the build process.
# Paths can be absolute or relative to the location of this YAML file.
# Note: Directory inclusion is non-recursive by default. Specifying '.' will include files
# only in the current directory and not in any subdirectories.
sources :
  - .            # Includes all files in the current directory, non-recursively.
  - src/main.c   # Specifies a single source file explicitly.

# Ignore files or directories:
# List all files or directories that should be excluded from the build process.
# Useful for excluding test files, documentation, or other non-essential components.

  - ignore.c     # Specifies a single file to be ignored during the build process.
